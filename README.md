# Understanding_Multi_phase_Optimization_NeurIPS2023

This repository holds the code for the numerical experiments in the paper ``Understanding Multi-phase Optimization Dynamics and Rich Nonlinear Behaviors of ReLU Networks'', Mingze Wang and Chao Ma, NeurIPS 2023 (Spotlight).

All experiments are conducted on a MacBook pro 13 (M2) only using CPU.

Run dynamics.ipynb first, then run vis_fix.ipynb.
